walkthrough
-take the "enable schizo submod" decision as soon as you enter the game
-when the event "a night in the library" happens, take the top option to read stuff (dork)
-win the civil war as OUM
-around 1855 you should get another event talking about Louis reading and getting funny ideas
-Get the "Cowboy king Triumphent" event (78548) to become an absolute monarchy (take red options during reconstruction)
-Play PLA as usual, win the second arcadian war and third arcadian war with NBG and Vinland respectively
-Form ARC
-Some time after this, Louis will give natives rights
-Once you have cores on the lower Great lakes states south of Vinland, you can decide to conquer Vinland
-After knocking out Vinland, you should finally be allowed to RETURN
-BRG will offer to join you if they exist
-After taking back England and France and controlling all of their cores, you will get an event about deciding your capital, if you have it in Paris, Belgium and Vinland will revolt. If you keep it in Nouvelle Orleans, England and Occitania will revolt. I recommend Paris.
-After crushing the revolts, you will be able to Proclaim the Triple Monarchy, getting Septiman and Vinlander as an accepted cultures. (Eventually, I want to add a new tag to represent this, but alas I am too lazy to make flags)
