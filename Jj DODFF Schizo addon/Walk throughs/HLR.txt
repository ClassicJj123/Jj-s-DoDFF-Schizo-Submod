Walk through for the voices chain (Only available after the "Imperial Acceptence" decision):

- Clicking the voices decision causes a event to pop which basically tells you the chain has started
- Afterwards you will get 3 events, each having two options, one listening to the voices and another fighting against it
- Event 1: choose to move your captial to ROME or Not
- Event 2: Accept the Anglois or not
- Event 3: Expansion or not
- depending on what you pick, you will get 4 endings, Healthly, Sane, Mildly Insane, Insane (For Full Schizo pick all choices that go with the voices)

Insane path:

- Congrats You've gone Insane!
- You will get a decision that gives cores over most of the Russian heart lands
- If Russia Exisits, you should get a decision that makes you get a treaty war with them
- To continue the path you must own all cores
- After owning all your cores you will get a event taling about your empire being unstable
- After that, another event fires telling you of Sigmund death (Basically telling you the civil war will happen soon)
- An month or so later the civil war will happen
- To win this, you MUSTN'T white peace or concede to ANYONE

That's it, have FUN!
