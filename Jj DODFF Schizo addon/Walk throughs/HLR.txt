Walk through for the voices chain:

- Clicking the voices decision causes a event to pop which basically tells you the chain has started
- Afterwards you will get 3 events, each having two options, one listening to the voices and another fighting against it
- depending on what you pick, you will get 4 endings, Healthly, Sane, Mildly Insane, Insane (For Full Schizo pick all choices that go with the voices)

Insane path:

- Congrats You've gone Insane!
- You will get a decision that gives gore over most of the Russian heart lands
- If Russia Exisits, you should get a decision that makes you get a treaty war with them
- To continue the path you must own all cores
